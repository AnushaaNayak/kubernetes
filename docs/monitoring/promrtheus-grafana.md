# Prometheus and Grafana: Monitoring Kubernetes Clusters

Prometheus and Grafana are widely used tools for monitoring and visualizing metrics in Kubernetes clusters. Prometheus collects and stores metrics, while Grafana provides a powerful interface for querying and visualizing these metrics. This guide provides an overview of Prometheus and Grafana, their benefits, and how to set them up in a Kubernetes cluster.

## Introduction
Prometheus and Grafana are essential tools for monitoring Kubernetes clusters. Prometheus collects metrics from Kubernetes components, applications, and infrastructure, while Grafana visualizes these metrics in customizable dashboards.

---

## Why Use Prometheus and Grafana?
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Collects metrics from Kubernetes nodes, pods, and applications.
- **Custom Dashboards**: Grafana allows you to create tailored dashboards for specific use cases.
- **Alerting**: Prometheus supports alerting rules to notify you of critical issues.
- **Scalability**: Both tools can handle large-scale Kubernetes clusters.

---

## Architecture
Prometheus and Grafana work together as follows:
1. **Prometheus**: Scrapes metrics from Kubernetes components and stores them in a time-series database.
2. **Grafana**: Queries Prometheus for metrics and visualizes them in dashboards.
3. **Alertmanager**: (Optional) Used with Prometheus to send alerts based on defined rules.

---

## Installation
> **Note:** Detailed installation steps will be added soon.

---

## Configuration
> **Note:** Configuration details for Prometheus, Grafana, and Alertmanager will be added soon.

---

## Creating Dashboards
Grafana allows you to create custom dashboards to visualize metrics. Example steps:
1. Log in to Grafana.
2. Add Prometheus as a data source.
3. Create a new dashboard and add panels for specific metrics.
4. Use PromQL (Prometheus Query Language) to query metrics.

Example PromQL queries:
- CPU usage of a pod:
  ```promql
  sum(rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{pod="my-app-pod"}[5m]))
  ```
- Memory usage of a node:
  ```promql
  sum(node_memory_MemTotal_bytes - node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes)
  ```
## Best Practices
- Use labels effectively in Prometheus to organize and query metrics.
- Set up retention policies to manage storage usage.
- Use Alertmanager to configure alerts for critical metrics.
- Monitor Prometheus and Grafana resource usage to ensure scalability.
