## Introduction
Grafana Loki is a log aggregation system optimized for Kubernetes. Unlike traditional log aggregation systems, Loki does not index the content of logs but instead indexes metadata such as labels. This makes it highly efficient and cost-effective for Kubernetes environments.

---

## Why Use Grafana Loki?
- **Kubernetes-Native**: Designed to work seamlessly with Kubernetes labels and metadata.
- **Cost-Effective**: Minimal indexing reduces storage and processing costs.
- **Integration with Grafana**: Provides a unified interface for metrics and logs.
- **Scalable**: Can handle large-scale Kubernetes clusters with ease.

---

## Architecture
Grafana Loki consists of the following components:
1. **Promtail**: A lightweight agent that collects logs from Kubernetes pods and forwards them to Loki.
2. **Loki**: The central log aggregation system that stores and indexes logs.
3. **Grafana**: A visualization tool used to query and display logs from Loki.

---

## Installation
> **Note:** Detailed installation steps will be added soon.

---

## Configuration
> **Note:** Configuration details for Promtail, Loki, and Grafana will be added soon.

---

## Querying Logs
Grafana Loki uses a query language called **LogQL** to filter and analyze logs. Example queries:
- Retrieve logs for a specific pod:
  ```logql
  {pod="my-app-pod"}
  ```
- Filter logs by a specific label:
  ```logql
  {app="my-app", level="error"}
  ```

## Best Practices  
- Use Kubernetes labels effectively to organize and query logs.  
- Monitor Loki's resource usage to ensure it scales with your cluster.  
- Set up retention policies to manage log storage efficiently.  
- Integrate Loki with Grafana dashboards for unified monitoring.
