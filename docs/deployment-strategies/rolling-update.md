# Rolling Update Deployment Strategy

Rolling Update is a deployment strategy that gradually replaces instances of the old version of an application with the new version. This ensures zero downtime and allows for a smooth transition between application versions. This document provides an overview of the Rolling Update strategy, its benefits, and how to implement it in Kubernetes.

## Introduction
Rolling Update is a strategy that allows you to update an application incrementally by replacing old instances with new ones. This ensures that the application remains available during the update process, making it ideal for production environments.

---

## How It Works
1. Deploy the new version of the application.
2. Gradually replace old instances with new ones, one at a time or in batches.
3. Monitor the performance and behavior of the new instances during the update.
4. Continue the rollout until all instances are updated to the new version.

---

## Benefits
- **Zero Downtime**: The application remains available throughout the update process.
- **Incremental Rollout**: Updates are applied gradually, reducing the risk of widespread issues.
- **Rollback Capability**: If issues are detected, the update can be paused or rolled back.

---

## Implementation in Kubernetes
> **Note:** Detailed steps for implementing Rolling Update Deployment in Kubernetes will be added soon.

---

## Best Practices
- Use Kubernetes Deployment objects to manage rolling updates.
- Define a **maxUnavailable** and **maxSurge** strategy to control the update process.
- Monitor key metrics (e.g., latency, error rates) during the update.
- Automate the deployment process using CI/CD pipelines.
