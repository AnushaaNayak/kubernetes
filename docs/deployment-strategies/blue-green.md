# Blue-Green Deployment Strategy

Blue-Green Deployment is a deployment strategy that minimizes downtime and risk by running two environments, one active (Blue) and one idle (Green). This document provides an overview of the Blue-Green Deployment strategy, its benefits, and how to implement it in Kubernetes.

## Introduction
Blue-Green Deployment is a strategy that allows you to deploy new versions of an application with minimal downtime. It involves maintaining two separate environments:
- **Blue Environment**: The currently active environment serving live traffic.
- **Green Environment**: The new environment where the updated application is deployed.

Once the Green environment is verified, traffic is switched from Blue to Green.

---

## How It Works
1. Deploy the new version of the application to the Green environment.
2. Test the Green environment to ensure it is functioning correctly.
3. Switch traffic from the Blue environment to the Green environment.
4. Optionally, keep the Blue environment as a fallback in case of issues.

---

## Benefits
- **Minimal Downtime**: Traffic is switched instantly, reducing downtime.
- **Rollback Capability**: The Blue environment can be used as a fallback if issues arise.
- **Testing in Isolation**: The Green environment can be tested without affecting live traffic.

---

## Implementation in Kubernetes
> **Note:** Detailed steps for implementing Blue-Green Deployment in Kubernetes will be added soon.

---

## Best Practices
- Use a **load balancer** or **Ingress controller** to manage traffic switching.
- Automate the deployment and traffic switching process using CI/CD pipelines.
- Monitor both environments during and after the deployment.
