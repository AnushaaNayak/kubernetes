# Canary Deployment Strategy

Canary Deployment is a deployment strategy that reduces risk by gradually rolling out changes to a small subset of users before deploying to the entire environment. This document provides an overview of the Canary Deployment strategy, its benefits, and how to implement it in Kubernetes.

## Introduction
Canary Deployment is a strategy that allows you to release new versions of an application incrementally. It involves routing a small percentage of traffic to the new version while the majority of traffic continues to use the stable version. This approach helps identify issues early without impacting all users.

---

## How It Works
1. Deploy the new version of the application alongside the existing version.
2. Route a small percentage of traffic to the new version (the "canary").
3. Monitor the performance and behavior of the canary version.
4. Gradually increase traffic to the canary version if no issues are detected.
5. Fully roll out the new version once it is deemed stable.

---

## Benefits
- **Reduced Risk**: Issues can be identified early without affecting all users.
- **Incremental Rollout**: Traffic is gradually shifted to the new version, allowing for controlled deployment.
- **Rollback Capability**: If issues are detected, traffic can be redirected back to the stable version.

---

## Implementation in Kubernetes
> **Note:** Detailed steps for implementing Canary Deployment in Kubernetes will be added soon.

---

## Best Practices
- Use a **traffic management tool** like Istio, Linkerd, or a service mesh to control traffic routing.
- Automate the deployment and traffic shifting process using CI/CD pipelines.
- Monitor key metrics (e.g., latency, error rates) during the rollout.
- Define clear rollback criteria to quickly revert changes if issues arise.
