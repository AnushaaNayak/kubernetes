# Recreate Deployment Strategy

Recreate Deployment is a strategy where all instances of the old version of an application are terminated before the new version is deployed. This approach ensures a clean deployment but involves downtime during the transition. This document provides an overview of the Recreate Deployment strategy, its benefits, and how to implement it in Kubernetes.

## Introduction
Recreate Deployment is a simple deployment strategy where the old version of an application is completely shut down before the new version is deployed. This ensures that there are no conflicts between the old and new versions but results in downtime during the deployment process.

---

## How It Works
1. Terminate all instances of the old version of the application.
2. Deploy the new version of the application.
3. Verify that the new version is functioning correctly.

---

## Benefits
- **Clean Deployment**: Ensures that no old instances are running, avoiding conflicts.
- **Simplicity**: Easy to implement and manage.
- **No Resource Overlap**: Frees up resources before deploying the new version.

---

## Implementation in Kubernetes
> **Note:** Detailed steps for implementing Recreate Deployment in Kubernetes will be added soon.

---

## Best Practices
- Use this strategy for applications where downtime is acceptable.
- Ensure proper monitoring and logging to verify the new version after deployment.
- Notify users about the planned downtime in advance.
- Automate the deployment process using CI/CD pipelines.
