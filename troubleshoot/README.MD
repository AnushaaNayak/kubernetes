# Troubleshooting Kubernetes Exit Codes

In Kubernetes, understanding exit codes is essential for diagnosing and resolving issues that arise within containers. Exit codes are returned by processes to indicate their success or failure. Each exit code has a specific meaning that helps developers troubleshoot problems efficiently.

## What are Exit Codes?
Exit codes are numerical values returned by a process when it terminates. They indicate whether the process executed successfully or encountered an error. A zero exit code typically means success, while any non-zero exit code indicates a failure, with specific codes signifying different types of errors.

## Why Do We Get Exit Codes?
Exit codes are generated by the underlying operating system and are often the result of various factors, such as:
- Command syntax errors
- Resource limitations (e.g., memory or CPU)
- Signal termination
- Application-specific errors

By understanding the exit codes, you can identify the root cause of issues and take corrective action.

## Exit Code Reference Table
Below is a list of common exit codes, their meanings, and links to hands-on examples available in this repository:
