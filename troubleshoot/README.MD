# Kubernetes Troubleshooting Guide.  



Yes, there are additional exit codes that can appear in a containerized or Linux environment. While the codes you've listed cover the most commonly encountered exit statuses in Kubernetes and Linux systems, here are a few more that might be useful to know:

### Other Exit Codes in Linux Environments

#### Exit Code 2: Misuse of Shell Built-ins
- **Meaning**: This exit code indicates an error due to misuse of shell built-in commands, like `cd`, `echo`, or `exit` itself.
- **Example**: Running `cd /nonexistent_directory` in a script would result in exit code 2 if the directory doesn’t exist.

#### Exit Code 3-126: Application-Specific Codes
- **Meaning**: These codes can vary depending on the application. Many applications define their own exit codes within this range to signify specific errors or states, but these aren’t universally standardized.

#### Exit Code 130: Script Terminated by `Ctrl+C` (SIGINT)
- **Meaning**: This code appears when a script or application is interrupted manually by the user (often with `Ctrl+C`).
- **Example**: If you start a process that is interrupted manually, it will exit with code 130, indicating a SIGINT signal (interrupt signal).

#### Exit Code 137 (SIGKILL) vs. Exit Code 9: Process Killed (Hard Kill)
- **Meaning**: Exit code 9 generally represents the hard kill signal (SIGKILL). While 137 is often seen in containerized environments as an indicator of out-of-memory (OOM) or manual termination with `kubectl delete`, Exit Code 9 is specific to the underlying Linux system.

#### Exit Code 141: SIGPIPE (Broken Pipe)
- **Meaning**: Exit code 141 is often related to SIGPIPE, which occurs when a process writes to a pipe with no reader. This can happen when piping between commands, and one of the commands exits before the other completes.
- **Example**: `echo "data" | false` will cause the `echo` command to exit with a SIGPIPE because the receiving command (`false`) terminated first.

#### Exit Code 143 vs. 15 (SIGTERM)
- **Meaning**: Exit code 143 indicates a SIGTERM termination in a container environment, while 15 generally represents SIGTERM in Linux.
  
#### Exit Code 152: SIGQUIT (Core Dump)
- **Meaning**: This exit code is triggered by the `SIGQUIT` signal. It produces a core dump and terminates the process.
  
#### Exit Code 255 (Specific Contexts)
- **Meaning**: In addition to what you’ve described, `exit 255` sometimes signifies a failure in SSH-related commands. For instance, if an SSH connection fails or times out, the process may exit with code 255.

### Summary of Rare but Useful Exit Codes

| **Exit Code** | **Description**                     | **Possible Reason**                       |
|---------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 2             | Misuse of shell built-ins           | Incorrect syntax in shell command         |
| 3-126         | Application-specific errors         | Varies based on application               |
| 130           | Interrupted by `Ctrl+C` (SIGINT)    | Manual interruption                      |
| 141           | Broken pipe (SIGPIPE)               | Piping failure                            |
| 152           | SIGQUIT (Core Dump)                 | Core dump generated on failure           |

These codes, although less commonly encountered in Kubernetes contexts, can help diagnose specific issues in complex containerized or shell-based environments.
